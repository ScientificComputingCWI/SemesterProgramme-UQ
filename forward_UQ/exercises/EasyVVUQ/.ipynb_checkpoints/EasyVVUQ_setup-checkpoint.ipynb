    "# Setting up a basic EasyVVUQ campaign\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is your first Jupyter Notebook - you can execute code cells by selecting them and pressing ```Shift+Enter```. Just have in mind that the order of execution might matter (if later cells depend on things done in earlier ones).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: if you installed EasyVVUQ using a virtual environment, make sure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) you activated the virtual environment, and\n",
    "2) you started this notebook with `myenv/bin/jupyterlab`.\n",
    "\n",
    "EasyVVUQ is a Python library designed to facilitate verification, validation and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) for a wide variety of simulations. It was first conceived and developed within the EU funded [VECMA](https://www.vecma.eu/) (Verified Exascale Computing for Multiscale Applications) project, and further developed in the UK-funded [SEAVEA project](https://www.seavea-project.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of EasyVVUQ is to facilitate verification, validation and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) for a wide variety of simulations. While very convenient for simple cases, EasyVVUQ is particularly well suited in situations where the simulations are computationally expensive, heterogeneous computing resources are necessary, the sampling space is very large or book-keeping is prohibitively complex. It coordinates execution using an efficient database, it is fault tolerant and all progress can be saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of questions EasyVVUQ can answer about your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given the uncertainties in input parameters, what is the distribution of the output?\n",
    "* What percentage of the output variance each input parameter contributes?\n",
    "* It also lets you construct surrogate models that are cheaper to evaluate than the complete simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functionality we will be focusing on in this tutorial are the Polynomials Chaos and Stochastic collocation samplers. We will test it out on the following advection diffusion equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\boxed{\n",
    "\\frac{du}{dx} - \\frac{1}{Pe}\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = f}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "This ODE solves for the velocity $u(x)$, where the spatial domain runs from $x\\in[0,1]$. Homogeneous boundary conditions are applied: $u(0)=u(1)=0$. The solution $u$ depends upon two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $Pe$: the so-called **Peclet number**, defined as the ratio between the rate of advection and the rate of diffusion,\n",
    "* $f$: the constant forcing term.\n",
    "\n",
    "A numerical solver (finite elements) of this equation is found in `advection_diffusion_model/advection_diffusion.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: While we are using a Python UQ library on a Python ODE model, this does not need to be the case. Models written in other programming languages are supported as well. The only requirements of EasyVVUQ are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model can be executed from the command line.\n",
    "* The model reads its input values from a file.\n",
    "* The model stores its output values to a (CSV / HDF5 / JSON) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input file of our advection-diffusion model is a simple JSON file, but the particular format is not important. It is located in `advection_diffusion_model/input.json`. The input file looks like this:"
